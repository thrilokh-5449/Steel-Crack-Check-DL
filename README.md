# This is a binary image classification Model

The dataset is Huge, hence it is not a part of this Repo.
**Download the dataset from "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arunrk7/surface-crack-detection" and extract the zip file to a folder named archive in the root directory of this project.**

The model.ipynb contains all the code from data loading to model saving. The images 00023.jpg and 00026.jpg are test samples for the model.
